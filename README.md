### Task1: Measuring the angle
TODO: Describe to examiner how the code works and how to use it on their own data

### Task2:

### Task3: SIFT Feature Matching
For this task, we have three files.
`main.py` contains the functionality for feature matching and an optimised method used for our parameter tuning process.

The file we used to tune our parameters is `hyperopt_parameter_tuning.py` and uses ... to tune. Depending on the machine, this file takes 1.5+ hrs to complete.

The file we have created for the markers use is `marker_test.py`. Near the end of the file there are three directories containing paths to the relevant datasets. Please replace these according to your needs, then execute that file to see how the our code performs, with details on...

We found that the processing of an average test image with our parameters is ...

The code we used to produce our graphs can be found in `graph_production.py`.
